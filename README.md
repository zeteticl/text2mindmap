## Please note
The current version of the tool utilizes some minified JavaScript and CSS code from the original [Text2MindMap.com](http://www.text2mindmap.com), which I didn't personally write. This was originally just meant to be a quick hack for personal use, and while I'm glad so many people have found a use for it, I unfortunately cannot dedicate the time I had originally intended to make this fully functioning web app. So let me reiterate, **this project is not in active development** at the current time, and might never be.
