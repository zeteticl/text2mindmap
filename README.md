## Please note
The current version of the tool utilizes some minified JavaScript and CSS code from the original [Text2MindMap.com](http://www.text2mindmap.com), which I didn't personally write. This was originally just meant to be a quick hack for personal use, and while I'm glad so many people have found a use for it, I unfortunately cannot dedicate the time I had originally intended to make this fully functioning web app. So let me reiterate, **this project is not in active development** at the current time, and might never be.

# Text2MindMap
An online tool for making mindmaps by writing indented lists.

A few months ago one of my favorite tools [Text2MindMap](http://www.text2mindmap.com) went down and since there doesn't seem to be any plans to bring it back up I created my own version of the site. It's basically just a quick mashup between some of the code from the original site and some code from my [Markdown Editor](https://tobloef.com/markant/), but I hope someone will find it as useful.
